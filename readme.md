[Better Bookmarks](https://jonah-saltzman.github.io/better-bookmarks/) is an app for managing Twitter Tweets. While bookmark functionality is built-in to Twitter's own apps, Twitter only provides one "folder" that stores all your bookmarked Tweets. With Better Bookmarks, you can create any number of folders to store Tweets for later, and a Twitter account is not required to do so. If you choose to connect your Twitter account to Better Bookmarks, you can easily add Tweets that you've "liked" to your Better Bookmarks folders; otherwise, an import feature lets you add any Tweet just by copy/pasting its URL. And even if a Tweet you've bookmarked gets deleted, Better Bookmarks allows you to view an archived version of the Tweet that lasts forever.

Please see the [client readme](https://github.com/jonah-saltzman/better-bookmarks) for a full description of the Better Bookmarks app.

## User Stories

Prior to starting the development of Better Bookmarks, I wrote the following user stories to guide my process:
 - As a twitter user, I want to be able to bookmark tweets into
   different folders that I define myself.
   
 - As a twitter user, I want my bookmarked tweets to be saved even if   
   one of them gets deleted from twitter.
   
 - As a Better Bookmarks user, I want it to be easy to find the tweets  
   that I want to bookmark.
   
 - As a Better Bookmarks user, I don't want Better Bookmarks to make any
   changes to my twitter account.
   
 - As a Better Bookmarks user, I want to be able to share my bookmark   
   folders with people who don't use Better Bookmarks.
